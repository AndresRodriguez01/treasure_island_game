Welcome to the Treasure Island Game! This is a text-based adventure game where your mission is to find the hidden treasure on a mysterious island. Make choices, explore, and see if you have what it takes to uncover the riches buried deep within!

## How to Play

1. Upon arriving on the island, you'll enter a cave with two paths: one to the left and the other to the right. Choose wisely by typing "left" or "right" when prompted.

2. After entering the cave, you'll encounter a strange lake in the middle of the castle. Decide whether you want to search for a small boat or swim in the lake. Type "search" to look for a boat or "swim" to brave the lake.

3. If you decide to search for a boat, you may find human remains inside it. You will then have to make a choice: take the key from the remains or leave it. Type "yes" to take the key or "no" to leave it behind.
